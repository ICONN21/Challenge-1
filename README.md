# Challenge-1

* The main goal of this Challenge was to refactor the code in order to make it more readable while meeting accessability standards. To acheive this, several steps were taken.
    1. The code was edited to contain fewer 'Div' tags to make the code more readable and concise.
    2. 'Alt' attributes were added to the to icon and image elements in order to comply with accesibility standards. 
    3. An updated title was added to better explain the intent of the website. 
    4. Classnames and ID's were edited to avoid redundant  code in the CSS file. 
    5. Ensured heading attribues fall in sequential order. 

This activity effectively enabled me to apply the new skills acquired during Module 1. I am looking forward to working on future projects!


To verify the effectiveness of the changes, ensuring that the webpage appeared identical to the mockup was crucial. This allowed for fewer lines of code while maining the integrity of the page.
